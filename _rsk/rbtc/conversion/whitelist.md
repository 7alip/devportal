## What is a _whitelist_?

The RSK whitelist is a list of addresses registered by people,
projects or entities that are considered to be
acceptable or trustworthy to use the
[2-way peg mechanism](https://www.rsk.co/blog/sidechains-drivechains-and-rsk-2-way-peg-design).

For both Mainnet and Testnet, you need to be whitelisted to
operate with the federation.

## Why is it necessary (for the moment)?

The whitelist process is a mechanism to gradually open up our platform
 We will remove this process, and the platform will be open to all soon.

On the Testnet, the process emulates exactly how it is done in Mainnet,
for testing purposes.

## How to be whitelisted?

### Mainnet

You must complete this [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoG_qF5wPY27tqcYnFbzNv4uwwDq6JeBe5no_zoYvKH62mBA/viewform) and we will contact you.

### Testnet

You can contact us in any of our
[Gitter channels](https://gitter.im/rsksmart/getting-started)
and ask us for the whitelisting.
Keep in mind that whitelisting in Testnet is just for
testing the 2-way-peg component.
If you only intend to test your smart contracts,
you can get funds for your RSK Testnet address from the
[faucet](https://faucet.testnet.rsk.co).

## What's next?

Once you are approved, you can proceed to
[convert your BTC to R-BTC](/rsk/rbtc/conversion).
