To use most Truffle commands, you need to run them against an existing Truffle project. So the first step is to create a Truffle project.

You can create a bare project template, but for those just getting started, you can use Truffle Boxes, which are example applications and project templates.

RSK has its own specialized Truffle Boxes:

- [rsk-starter-box](/tutorials/truffle-boxes/rsk-starter-box): This box comes with everything you need to start using smart contracts at RSK Network. It includes network configs for Mainnet and Testnet.
- [rsk-react-webpack-box](/tutorials/truffle-boxes/rsk-react-webpack-box): In this box you'll find a basic starter pack. It includes Truffle, React and Webpack. 
- [rsk-next-box](/tutorials/truffle-boxes/rsk-next-box): In this box you'll find a basic starter pack. It includes Truffle and Next JS.
- [rsk-react-express-box](/tutorials/truffle-boxes/rsk-react-express-box): In this box you'll find a basic starter pack. It includes Truffle, React and Express JS.
