This process describes how to find a name for a given address. This depends on the owner of the account having set its reverse resolution.

1. Go to [resolution page](https://manager.rns.rifos.org/resolve)
2. In the top text input type an address in lower case without `0x` at the beginning, followed by `.addr.reverse`.
