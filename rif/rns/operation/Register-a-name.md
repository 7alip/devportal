The process consists of three main steps:

1. [Check availability](#check-availability)
2. [Request to register](#request-to-register)
3. [Reveal commit to register the domain](#reveal-commit-to-register-the-domain)

## Check availability

You need to check if your name is available. Go to the <a href="https://beta.manager.rns.rifos.org/search">RNS Manager</a> and check it!

If your name is available, click on "register your domain", and go to the next step.

## Request to register

Select the duration for which you would like to register your name, check that you have that amount of RIF Tokens, and click on "Request to register".

Sign the transaction and wait for one minute. We're almost done!

## Reveal commit to register the domain

After approximately one minute, the "Register" button will be enabled, and you will be able to finalize the process.

To do so, click on the "Register" button, sign the transaction, and you'll get your selected name!
