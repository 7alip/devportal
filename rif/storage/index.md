title: About RIF Storage
---

RIF Storage is an open, censorship resistant, permissionless and decentralized storage protocol. It provides a unified interfaceto a 3rd party decentralized storage providers like [IPFS](/rif/storage/ipfs) or [Swarm](/rif/storage/swarm) making it easy . We are adding incentives to these systems to ensure resistance to trivial attacks, availability and to allow participants to be rewarded for their participation in the network.

As an end-user RIF Storage allows you to take back ownership of your data. Even if service you are using stops existing you can retrieve all your content.

As a developer/service creator RIF Storage allows you to not worry about storage for your application and it also comes with content delivery service out of the box so your application scales without you having to invest in the infrastructure.

Thanks to the build in incentives, anyone is able to become storage provider and offer their unused storage to others and get paid for it.
