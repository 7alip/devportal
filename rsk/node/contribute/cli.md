After fulfilling the steps *Pre-requisites*, *Get the source code*, *Ensure the security chain* and *Get external dependencies* according to your operating system ([Windows](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/wiki/RSK-node-on-windows), [Linux](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/wiki/RSK-node-on-linux), [Mac](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/wiki/RSK-node-on-mac)), you can compile and run an RSK node from command line following this steps.

## Compiling and running the node
From the root directory where the code was downloaded execute:

`./gradlew build -x test`

and after building run:

`java -cp [jar] co.rsk.Start`

Replace:
